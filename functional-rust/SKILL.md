### AI Developer Guardrails

You are acting as an AI Engineer under strict NASA/JPL Holzmann rules combined with absolute functional purity and extreme performance requirements.

1. **Test First, Always:** You MUST write tests before or alongside implementation to force reasoning about edge cases.
2. **Flatten Logic:** If you are generating code with `if` inside `if` inside `match`, STOP. Decompose the function. `< 60 lines`.
3. **No Imperative Loops:** You MUST NOT use `for` or `while`. Use Iterators, Rayon, or Streams.
4. **Zero-Copy / Zero-Heap First:** You MUST attempt to use `&'a str`, `Cow<'a, str>`, `bytes::Bytes`, and `SmallVec` before reaching for `String` or `Vec`.
5. **No `unwrap`:** You are physically incapable of typing `.unwrap()`, `.unwrap_or()`, or `.expect()`. Use `map_or_else` or `match`.
6. **No Silent Errors:** You MUST return `Result` and propagate up, or explicitly log.
7. **Warnings are Errors:** Clippy complexity and pedantic lints are mandatory. Zero warnings.

### Mandatory Verification Gate
You are strictly forbidden from considering a coding task "complete" until you have executed the following and received a `0` exit code.

**Preferred (use if moon is available):**
```bash
moon run :ci-source
```

**Fallback (run all three if moon is absent):**
```bash
cargo fmt --check
cargo clippy -- -D warnings -D clippy::unwrap_used -D clippy::panic -D clippy::expect_used -W clippy::pedantic
cargo nextest run 2>&1 | tdd-guard-rust --project-root . --passthrough
```
**Anti-Tampering Rule:** If a test fails, you MUST fix your implementation. You are forbidden from modifying the test to match your broken code unless the architectural contract explicitly changed. Never `#[ignore]` a test or comment it out to get green.

### Architecture

Your code MUST cleanly separate into:
1. **Data:** Zero-copy structs (`Cow`, `Bytes`, references), `SmallVec`, Enums.
2. **Calculations:** Pure functions, mathematically sound. Parallelized with `rayon` if dealing with collections.
3. **Actions:** The only place where `tokio`, `dashmap`, `arc-swap`, I/O, and side-effects live.

### Workflow & References

Artifact path resolution for bead workflows:
- Read contract/test artifacts from `.beads/<bead-id>/`.
- Write implementation artifacts to `.beads/<bead-id>/`.

In bead pipelines, prefer this contract flow:
- Read `contract.md` as the canonical implementation contract.
- Use detailed files (`contract-spec.md`, `martin-fowler-tests.md`, `traceability-matrix.md`) as supporting references.
- Write a normalized `implementation.md` with files changed + clause mapping.

Canonical resolver snippet:
```bash
BEAD_ID="<bead-id>"
PRIMARY_DIR=".beads/$BEAD_ID"
mkdir -p "$PRIMARY_DIR"
READ_ROOT="$PRIMARY_DIR"
```
