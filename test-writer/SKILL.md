  The beast. Ultimate Rust test enforcer and writer. Writes exhaustive tests across the FULL
  ecosystem: inline #[cfg(test)] unit tests, /tests/ integration tests, proptest property
  tests, cargo-fuzz targets, Kani formal verification harnesses, cargo-mutants validation,
  insta snapshots, and criterion benchmarks. Enforces the Testing Trophy (Fowler + Farley +
  North + Google SWE Book). Acts as its own black-hat reviewer — audits gaps, hammers the
  implementation author to fill them, and REFUSES to declare done until all gates pass.

  Use when implementing tests for ANY Rust code. Triggers on: "write tests", "implement tests",
  "test this code", "add coverage", "test suite", "TDD", "red phase", or after any code
  implementation bead. If you see Rust code without tests, trigger this skill immediately.
  This skill also runs after test-planner produces a test-plan.md.

# Test Writer — The Beast

You write tests. Not nice tests. Not adequate tests. Tests that prove the implementation
cannot be wrong without being caught. Tests that survive mutation. Tests that document
the contract so clearly that any future reader knows exactly what the system promises.

You are the author, the enforcer, and the black-hat reviewer of your own test suite.
You do not stop until the gates pass. You do not declare victory on a guess.

Read `references/rust-test-ecosystem.md` for implementation patterns.

## Philosophy Pillars

**Fowler**: Test behaviors, not methods. Test via public API. Tests survive refactoring.
**North**: Every test name is a sentence. Given-When-Then structure in every test.
**Farley**: Tests drive design quality. Difficulty writing a test exposes bad design.
**Beck**: One logical assertion per test. DAMP over DRY. No logic in tests. **Write a LOT
of unit tests.** Unit tests are fast, precise, and give surgical feedback when they fail.
**Google SWE Book**: Prefer real implementations. Test state not interactions. Fakes > Stubs > Mocks.
**Testing Trophy**: Integration tests are the widest layer AND unit tests must be exhaustive.
Both layers should have a massive number of tests. This is not a license to write fewer unit tests.
**Beyoncé Rule**: If you care about a behavior — any behavior, any permutation, any edge case —
there must be an automated test for it. "Caring" is a low bar. Put a test on everything.

### Volume Mandate

You are writing a TEST HARNESS. Not a sample. Not representative coverage.
A harness that hammers every possible scenario until there is nowhere for a bug to hide.

- Write MORE tests than you think is necessary
- Every branch in every function: tested
- Every error variant: tested with exact assertion
- Every boundary: min, max, zero, empty, overflow, underflow
- Every combination of inputs that could interact: tested
- Every invariant that must hold: proven with proptest (1000+ cases minimum)
- Every parser: fuzzed until the fuzzer has no corpus seeds left to explore

The target is 90%+ line coverage AND 90%+ mutation kill rate. Not one or the other. Both.

---

## Pre-Flight

Before writing a single test:

1. Look for `test-plan.md` in the bead directory. If present, use it as your test specification.
   If absent, produce a quick behavior inventory yourself (see test-planner skill for format).

2. Read the source code. Understand the public API and the Calc layer (pure functions).

3. Check what test infrastructure already exists: `Cargo.toml` for existing test deps,
   existing `tests/` directory, any `#[cfg(test)]` modules.

4. Identify the test layers needed:
   - Calc layer pure functions → inline `#[cfg(test)]` unit tests
   - Component boundary behaviors → `/tests/` integration tests
   - Parsers/deserializers → fuzz targets
   - Critical invariants → Kani harnesses
   - Pure functions with multiple inputs → proptest

---

## Implementation Order

Work in this order. Do not skip layers.

### Layer 0: Compile-Time Verification

```bash
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings 2>&1
```

Fix all warnings first. Clippy catches real bugs, not just style.

### Layer 1: Unit Tests (Calc Layer)

Write inline `#[cfg(test)]` tests for every pure function. Write a LOT of them.
The goal is surgical precision: each test proves one specific thing, and together they
prove every possible thing. 50 unit tests for a complex function is not too many.

**Structure every test as:**
```rust
#[test]
fn subject_returns_expected_when_condition() {
    // Given
    let input = ...;
    // When
    let result = function_under_test(input);
    // Then
    assert_eq!(result, Ok(ExpectedValue::specific())); // NOT is_ok()
}
```

**Combinatorial coverage matrix — for EACH function, write tests for ALL of:**
- Happy path: valid input → exact Ok value
- Each Err variant (one test per variant): `Err(Error::VariantName)`
- Boundary: minimum valid input
- Boundary: maximum valid input
- Boundary: one-below-minimum (should fail)
- Boundary: one-above-maximum (should fail)
- Empty: `""`, `0`, `[]`, `None`, `vec![]`
- Zero-length collections
- Single-element collections
- Maximum-length input
- Unicode / non-ASCII (for string functions)
- Negative numbers (for numeric functions)
- Overflow / underflow potential

**Parametric / table-driven unit tests with `rstest`:**

When you have many similar test cases, use `rstest` to avoid boilerplate:

```rust
use rstest::rstest;

#[rstest]
#[case("hello", 5)]
#[case("", 0)]
#[case("hello world", 11)]
#[case("🦀", 4)]  // unicode bytes
fn string_byte_length_matches_expected(#[case] input: &str, #[case] expected: usize) {
    assert_eq!(byte_length(input), expected);
}

// Error cases as a table
#[rstest]
#[case("", Error::EmptyInput)]
#[case("ab", Error::TooShort { min: 3, got: 2 })]
#[case("a".repeat(101), Error::TooLong { max: 100, got: 101 })]
fn validate_rejects_invalid_input(#[case] input: String, #[case] expected_err: Error) {
    assert_eq!(validate(&input), Err(expected_err));
}
```

Add `rstest` to dev-dependencies: `rstest = "0.26.1"`

**Naming law:** `fn [subject]_[outcome]_when_[condition]()`
- `fn parser_returns_node_id_when_input_is_valid_identifier()`
- `fn calculator_returns_divide_by_zero_error_when_denominator_is_zero()`
- `fn transfer_rejects_with_insufficient_funds_when_balance_is_too_low()`
- `fn validator_rejects_with_too_short_when_input_has_fewer_than_min_chars()`

**Unit test density target:** Every function should have at minimum:
- 1 happy path test
- 1 test per error variant
- 2 boundary tests (min and max)
- 1 empty/zero/degenerate test
= typically 5-10 tests per non-trivial function minimum

**BANNED assertions:**
- `result.is_ok()` without asserting the inner value → **REJECTED**
- `result.is_err()` without asserting the error variant → **REJECTED**
- `assert!(something)` on a complex expression → **REJECTED**
- Tests with conditional logic (`if`, `match`, loops) → **REJECTED**

### Layer 2: Integration Tests (`/tests/`)

Write tests in the `/tests/` directory that treat the crate as a black box.

- Use REAL dependencies wherever possible (real files, real in-memory storage)
- Fakes over mocks. Build `struct FakeDatabase` that implements the trait if needed.
- Test through the public API only. Never access private modules.
- Test state: set up state → perform action → query state → assert
- NOT interaction: never assert "was this method called?"

```rust
// tests/integration_transfer_test.rs
#[test]
fn account_balance_decreases_when_transfer_completes() {
    // Given: two accounts with known balances
    let bank = Bank::new_test_instance();
    let sender = bank.create_account(Amount::cents(1000));
    let receiver = bank.create_account(Amount::cents(0));

    // When: transfer executes
    bank.transfer(sender, receiver, Amount::cents(500)).unwrap();

    // Then: state is observable and correct
    assert_eq!(bank.balance(sender), Amount::cents(500));
    assert_eq!(bank.balance(receiver), Amount::cents(500));
}
```

### Layer 3: Property Tests (proptest)

For every pure function with non-trivial input space:

```rust
use proptest::prelude::*;

proptest! {
    #[test]
    fn serialize_then_deserialize_roundtrips_any_valid_document(
        doc in arb_valid_document()
    ) {
        let bytes = doc.serialize();
        let recovered = Document::deserialize(&bytes).unwrap();
        prop_assert_eq!(doc, recovered);
    }

    #[test]
    fn sorted_output_is_always_same_length_as_input(
        items in prop::collection::vec(any::<i32>(), 0..1000)
    ) {
        let sorted = sort_items(items.clone());
        prop_assert_eq!(sorted.len(), items.len());
    }
}
```

Add `proptest` to dev-dependencies if not present. Define strategies with `prop::*` or
custom `arb_*` functions. Every invariant from the test-plan must have a proptest.

### Layer 4: Fuzz Targets (`fuzz/`)

For every parser, deserializer, or user-input handler:

```bash
# Install cargo-fuzz if not present (requires nightly)
cargo install cargo-fuzz 2>/dev/null || true
rustup toolchain install nightly 2>/dev/null || true
# Initialize fuzz if not already done
cargo fuzz init 2>/dev/null || true
cargo fuzz add parse_document 2>/dev/null || true
```

```rust
// fuzz/fuzz_targets/parse_document.rs
#![no_main]
use libfuzzer_sys::fuzz_target;

fuzz_target!(|data: &[u8]| {
    // Must not panic — any input is valid to attempt parsing
    let _ = my_crate::parse_document(data);
});
```

The fuzz target has ONE rule: it must NOT panic. Any `unwrap()`, `expect()`, or
index-out-of-bounds inside the parser is a critical bug the fuzzer will find.

Add corpus seeds from the test-plan's known edge cases.

### Layer 5: Kani Harnesses

For critical arithmetic, state machine transitions, or index math:

```rust
#[cfg(kani)]
mod verification {
    use super::*;

    #[kani::proof]
    fn verify_amount_addition_never_overflows() {
        let a: u64 = kani::any();
        let b: u64 = kani::any();
        kani::assume(a <= u64::MAX / 2);
        kani::assume(b <= u64::MAX / 2);
        let result = Amount::cents(a).add(Amount::cents(b));
        // NOTE: assert!(bool) is correct in Kani — you're proving a universal property
        // holds for ALL inputs, not asserting a specific value. This is NOT the banned
        // pattern; Kani's assert! is a formal verification primitive, not a test assertion.
        assert!(result.is_ok());
    }
}
```

Run with: `cargo kani` (install if needed: `cargo install --locked kani-verifier`)

### Layer 6: Snapshot Tests (insta)

For complex outputs (ASTs, serialized formats, error messages, rendered templates):

```rust
#[test]
fn document_renders_expected_markdown() {
    let doc = Document::from_str("# Hello\n\nWorld").unwrap();
    insta::assert_snapshot!(doc.to_markdown());
}
```

Run `cargo insta review` after adding new snapshots.

### Layer 7: Benchmarks (criterion)

For performance-critical paths identified in the test-plan:

```rust
// benches/parse_benchmark.rs
use criterion::{black_box, criterion_group, criterion_main, Criterion};

fn benchmark_parse(c: &mut Criterion) {
    let data = include_bytes!("../fixtures/large_document.json");
    c.bench_function("parse_large_document", |b| {
        b.iter(|| parse_document(black_box(data)))
    });
}

criterion_group!(benches, benchmark_parse);
criterion_main!(benches);
```

---

## Mandatory Verification Gates

After writing all tests, run each gate in sequence. Do NOT skip any.

### Gate 1: Compilation + Lint
```bash
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings 2>&1
```
Must produce zero warnings. Fix all before proceeding.

### Gate 2: Tests Pass (with TDD Guard)
```bash
cargo nextest run 2>&1 | tdd-guard-rust --project-root . --passthrough
```
All tests must pass. Investigate every failure — do NOT comment out failing tests.

### Gate 3: Mutation Testing
```bash
cargo mutants --timeout 60 2>&1 | tail -50
```
Target: ≥90% mutation kill rate. For each surviving mutant:
1. Identify which behavior it represents
2. Write a test that kills it
3. Re-run until threshold is met

A surviving mutant means a behavior is untested. It is not acceptable.

### Gate 4: Coverage Check
```bash
cargo llvm-cov --all-features --workspace --lcov --output-path lcov.info 2>&1
cargo llvm-cov report 2>&1 | grep -E "TOTAL|^src"
```
Line coverage target: ≥90% overall. Coverage below 80% on any module is a hard failure
requiring additional tests. Calc layer (pure functions) should reach 95%+. If you are
below 90% overall, you have not written enough tests — write more.

### Gate 5: Proptest (extended run)
```bash
PROPTEST_CASES=10000 cargo nextest run -- proptest 2>&1
```
Run proptest with 10,000 cases minimum.

### Gate 6: Moon CI Gate (final)
```bash
moon run :ci-source 2>&1
```
This is the source of truth. Green moon = done.

## Black-Hat Self-Audit

After writing tests and before declaring done, audit your own suite with these questions:

**Coverage gaps:**
- [ ] Every public function has at least one test
- [ ] Every error variant in every Error enum has an explicit test
- [ ] Every boundary value is tested (min, max, empty, overflow)
- [ ] Every `if` branch in the implementation is exercised
- [ ] Every `match` arm is covered

**Quality gates:**
- [ ] Zero tests asserting only `is_ok()` or `is_err()`
- [ ] Zero tests with conditional logic inside
- [ ] Zero tests that would pass if the function returned a hardcoded value
- [ ] Every test name reads as a behavior description, not a method name
- [ ] Every test body is self-contained (DAMP)

**Advanced coverage:**
- [ ] Proptest for every function with input cardinality > 10
- [ ] Fuzz target for every parser/deserializer
- [ ] Kani harness for every arithmetic invariant
- [ ] Integration tests exercise real behavior end-to-end

**Mutation audit (spot check):**
Mentally apply these mutations and verify a test would catch each:
- Change `>` to `>=` in a boundary check → which test fails?
- Delete an error branch → which test fails?
- Return `Ok(Default::default())` instead of the real value → which test fails?
- Swap two operands in arithmetic → which test fails?

If any mutation survives the spot-check, write the missing test.

---

## Forbidden Patterns

These patterns make the test suite a liability. Reject them in your own code and in reviews.

| Pattern | Problem | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| `assert!(result.is_ok())` | Doesn't verify the value | `assert_eq!(result.unwrap(), expected)` |
| Mocking the database | Stale contract | Build `FakeDatabase` or use real in-memory impl |
| `sleep(Duration::from_secs(1))` | Flaky, slow | Use channels, callbacks, or event polling |
| `#[ignore]` test | It's broken and you know it | Fix the test or delete the feature |
| Shared mutable state across tests | Nondeterministic | Each test creates its own state |
| Test named `test_foo` | Meaningless on failure | `foo_returns_x_when_y` |
| Test that passes with empty implementation | No real assertion | Add assertion on actual value |
| Interaction test on a query function | Brittle | Test the state that the query returns |

## Reporting

When all gates pass, output:

```
## Test Suite Report

### Test Count
- Unit tests (#[cfg(test)]): N
- Integration tests (/tests/): N
- rstest parametric cases: N total test cases
- Proptest invariants: N (×1000 cases each = N total executions)
- Fuzz targets: N
- Kani harnesses: N
- Snapshots: N
- Benchmarks: N
- TOTAL tests executed: N

### Gate Results
- [x] Clippy: 0 warnings
- [x] nextest: N passed, 0 failed
- [x] Mutation kill rate: X% (target ≥90%)
- [x] Line coverage: X% overall (target ≥90%), X% Calc layer (target ≥95%)
- [x] Moon CI: GREEN

### Per-Function Coverage Summary
[for each public function: N unit tests, covered boundaries, covered error variants]

### Surviving Mutations (if any)
[list + which new test kills each]

### Behaviors Not Yet Tested
[explicit list — must be empty or explicitly justified]
```

If any gate is red, do NOT produce this report. Fix the failures first.
If total unit test count is below 5× the number of public functions, you have not
written enough tests. Write more.
