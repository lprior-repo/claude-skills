# BDD Enforcer: No Scenario, No Ship

Code without behavioral scenarios is an unverified promise. This enforcer ensures
every user-facing behavior is specified and proven through executable Given/When/Then
scenarios before shipping.

## Core Discipline

A BDD scenario: **Given** preconditions → **When** action → **Then** observable outcome.

If you can't express it this way, you aren't testing behavior.

## The Enforcement Protocol

### STEP 1: Extract the Behavior Catalog

Read the source of truth — bead description, spec, contract, issue. Extract every
promised behavior into a numbered catalog of Given/When/Then scenarios.

See [reference.md](reference.md#behavior-catalog-example) for the catalog format.

### STEP 2: Discover Existing Infrastructure

Before writing any test code, find what already exists:

```bash
# Find test files and helpers
find . -path ./target -prune -o -name "*test*" -print -o -name "*fixture*" -print | head -30

# Find test helper patterns
grep -rn "mod test\|fn setup\|fn fixtures\|TestApp\|TestContext\|test_util" --include="*.rs" | head -20
```

Use discovered helpers. Don't invent APIs that already exist.

### STEP 3: Map Coverage → STEP 4: Write Missing Scenarios

Classify each behavior: COVERED / PARTIAL / MISSING. Write scenarios for every gap.

See [reference.md](reference.md#scenario-example-rust) for scenario code patterns
and [reference.md](reference.md#assertion-depth-guide) for assertion quality requirements.

### STEP 5: Execute All Scenarios

```bash
cargo test -- --nocapture 2>&1
```

**Show the real output.** Always. No output = no proof.

### STEP 6: Fix Failures

Every failure: read output → diagnose → fix → re-run → show green. Repeat.

### STEP 7: Verify Coverage

Cross-reference catalog against results. All GREEN or DO NOT SHIP.

See [reference.md](reference.md#coverage-map-format) for the coverage map format.

### STEP 8: Regression Check

```bash
cargo test 2>&1  # Full suite, not just new scenarios
```

### STEP 9: Final Report

See [reference.md](reference.md#final-report-template) for the complete report template.

## Adapting by Target Type

See [reference.md](reference.md#target-type-adaptations) for per-language patterns
(Rust, TypeScript, Go, API, CLI, Bug Fix).

## Anti-Patterns

- **Testing private functions** — if users can't reach it, don't test it
- **Mock overload** — mock only external third-party services
- **Assertion-free scenarios** — running without asserting = lying
- **One function per scenario** — BDD tests behaviors, not functions
- **Skipping Given** — every scenario needs explicit setup state
- **Shared mutable state** — scenarios must run independently
